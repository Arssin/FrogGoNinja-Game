# Hello my name is Mateusz Biniƒôda and this is Ninja Frog!

I made this project for training pruposes. 
</br>
Always wanted to make a small game, and also i want to see how's HTML Canvas doing.
</br>
``I know game could be a bit difficult, but more challenge = more fun. üòÅ``
</br>
There are some things that i will fix and add in the future.

Assets from the: https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/pixel-adventure-1

## I used here: 

JavaScript, HTML Canvas, WebPack, and minimal CSS styling inside of HTML. Also used Tiled, for drawing some background, platfroms, blocks and generic objects.

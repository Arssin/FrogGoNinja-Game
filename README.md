# Hello my name is Mateusz Biniƒôda and this is FrogGoNinja!

I made this project for training pruposes. 
</br>
Always wanted to make a small game, and also i want to see how's HTML Canvas doing.
</br>
``I know game could be a bit difficult, but more challenge = more fun. üòÅ``
</br>
There are some things that i will fix and add in the future. 

Game has 2 levels, if you made thru first it's gonna be stored in LocalStorage, you can restart LocalStorage with in-game button.



Assets from the: https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/pixel-adventure-1

## I used here: 

JavaScript, HTML Canvas, WebPack, and minimal CSS styling inside of HTML. Also used Tiled, for drawing some background, platfroms, blocks and generic objects. 

You can play the game by cloning repository or simply click the link: https://froggoninja.netlify.app/
